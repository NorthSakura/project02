## Areas of Improvement

Our main goal is to improve the readability of the chosen website. This is because the website we chose had a strong information architecture design, however, the layout of the site is not conducive to reading all of the information. We modified the IA slightly to make the page a little more simple (less subheadings, focusing on the important information).

Our first area of improvement is the addition of a Z-Layout homepage. This will serve as the landing page for the website, and will direct the user into one of the four cities on the site. Our second area of improvement will be refactoring the city pages to an F-Layout, with an additional sidebar navigation that allows users to move between subsections of the page. The top navigation bar will serve to navigate between the different cities. The F-Layout will allow for easier scanning of information throughout the pages, as it follows the reading gravity of the page.

## Fonts

We have selected these two fonts as we believe they will improve the readability of the website as a whole. With Pt Serif font for the headings and PT sans for the paragraphs and descriptive text, the font-pair creates a sense of synchrony across the website providing the reader with a seamless reading experience.

The fonts selected are both modern (PT Sans) and Elegant (PT Serif). Our "vision" for the website was that of a travel agency that aimed to combine the two feelings. 

According to the creator Paratype, PT serif was designed for use together with PT Sans, and both are harmonized across metrics, proportions, weights and design. With our mockup wireframe, we believe that these fonts will add well to the alignment of the text paragraphs and headings. They are also web safe fonts meaning that they will be consistent across all web browsers.
