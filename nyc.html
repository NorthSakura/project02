			<h2>History & Facts</h2>

			<div>
				<h3>History</h3>
					<p>The diverse population runs the gamut from some of America's wealthiest celebrities and socialites to homeless people. There are millions of immigrants living in the city. New York's population has been diverse since the city's founding by the Dutch. Successive waves of immigration from virtually every nation in the world make New York a giant social experiment in cross-cultural harmony. The city's ethnic heritage illuminates different neighborhoods throughout the five boroughs. Manhattan's Chinatown remains a vibrant center of New York City's Chinese community, though in recent years the very large Chinese community in Flushing, Queens, has rivaled if not eclipsed it in importance, and three other Chinatowns have formed in New York City: the Brooklyn Chinatown in Sunset Park; the Elmhurst Chinatown in Queens; and the Avenue U Chinatown located in the Homecrest section of Brooklyn.</p>

			<h2>Geography & Climate</h2>

			<div>
				<h3>Geography</h3>
					<p>New York City is situated in the northeastern United States, in southeastern New York State, approximately halfway between Washington, D.C. and Boston. The location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of New York City is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island. The Hudson River flows through the Hudson Valley into New York Bay. Between New York City and Troy, New York, the river is an estuary. The Bronx River, which flows through the Bronx and Westchester County, is the only entirely freshwater river in the city. The city's total area is 468.484 square miles (1,213.37 km2); 302.643 sq mi (783.84 km2) of the city is land and 165.841 sq mi (429.53 km2) of this is water. The highest point in the city is Todt Hill on Staten Island, which, at 409.8 feet (124.9 m) above sea level, is the highest point on the eastern seaboard south of Maine. The summit of the ridge is mostly covered in woodlands as part of the Staten Island Greenbelt.

				<h3>Regional Climate</h3>
					<p>New York City has a humid subtropical climate, experiencing all four seasons and with about 50 inches (1,200mm) of rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year. Depending on the time of the year you visit it would be optimal to know what kind of weather you should expect. Winter: Winters in NYC are chilly and damp. However due to the moderating effect of the ocean and the urban heat island, the city does have warmer temperatures when compared to other cities on the same latitude like Pittsburgh, Columbus or Indianapolis. Nighttime lows usually hover around freezing and daytime highs are usually between the low 40s and the mid 50s (5C-15C). How cold or how warm it gets though depends greatly upon the location you're at in the city: the northern and western parts of the metropolitan area (like The Bronx, Yonkers and Newark) are usually colder during the night while the southern - southeastern areas such as Staten Island and Long Island may have milder temperatures. Sometimes the mercury may dip down to the teens (around -10C) but prolonged cold periods are very rare. New York is the second snowiest city out of the big 5 in the northeast, being 17 inches behind Boston but 5 inches in front of Philadelphia. The first snowfall of the year usually happens around early or mid-December and the last one in late February or early March. The city is prone to big snowstorms that can produce up to 1-2 feet of snow. While such events can create a winter wonderland keep in mind that they can also cause big traffic bottlenecks especially on highways.</p>
